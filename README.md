# react-native-background-downloader

## This repo is no longer actively maintained by eko, however you may be interested in checking out this [fork](https://github.com/kesha-antonov/react-native-background-downloader) ##

A library for React-Native to help you download large files on iOS and Android both in the foreground and most importantly in the background.

### Why?
On iOS, if you want to download big files no matter the state of your app, wether it's in the background or terminated by the OS, you have to use a system API called `NSURLSession`.

This API handles your downloads separately from your app and only keeps it informed using delegates (Read: [Downloading Files in the Background](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url_loading_system/downloading_files_in_the_background)).

On Android we are simulating this process with a wonderful library called [Fetch2](https://github.com/tonyofrancis/Fetch)

The real challenge of using this method is making sure the app's UI is always up-to-date with the downloads that are happening in another process because your app might startup from scratch while the downloads are still running.

`react-native-background-downloader` gives you an easy API to both downloading large files and re-attaching to those downloads once your app launches again.

> **Please Note** - This library was created to better facilitate background downloading on iOS. If you're not aiming to to use the download-in-background functionality, there are better solutions like [RNFS.downloadFile()](https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs#downloadfileoptions-downloadfileoptions--jobid-number-promise-promisedownloadresult-) which will results in a more stable download experience for your app.

## ToC

- [Usage](#usage)
- [API](#api)
- [Constants](#constants)

## Getting started

`$ yarn add react-native-background-downloader`

For **`RN <= 0.57.0`** use `$ yarn add react-native-background-downloader@1.1.0`

### Mostly automatic installation
Any React Native version **`>= 0.60`** supports autolinking so nothing should be done.

For anything **`< 0.60`** run the following link command

`$ react-native link react-native-background-downloader`

### Manual installation


#### iOS

1. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
2. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-background-downloader` and add `RNBackgroundDownloader.xcodeproj`
3. In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libRNBackgroundDownloader.a` to your project's `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`
4. Run your project (`Cmd+R`)

#### Android

1. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java`
  - Add `import com.eko.RNBackgroundDownloaderPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
  - Add `packages.add(new RNBackgroundDownloaderPackage());` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method
2. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:
  	```
  	include ':react-native-background-downloader'
  	project(':react-native-background-downloader').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/react-native-background-downloader/android')
  	```
3. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:
  	```
      compile project(':react-native-background-downloader')
  	```

### iOS - Extra Mandatory Step
In your `AppDelegate.m` add the following code:
```objc
...
#import <RNBackgroundDownloader.h>

...

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:(NSString *)identifier completionHandler:(void (^)(void))completionHandler
{
  [RNBackgroundDownloader setCompletionHandlerWithIdentifier:identifier completionHandler:completionHandler];
}

...
```
Failing to add this code will result in canceled background downloads.

## Usage

### Downloading a file

```javascript
import RNBackgroundDownloader from 'react-native-background-downloader';

let task = RNBackgroundDownloader.download({
	id: 'file123',
	url: 'https://link-to-very.large/file.zip'
	destination: `${RNBackgroundDownloader.directories.documents}/file.zip`
}).begin((expectedBytes) => {
	console.log(`Going to download ${expectedBytes} bytes!`);
}).progress((percent) => {
	console.log(`Downloaded: ${percent * 100}%`);
}).done(() => {
	console.log('Download is done!');
}).error((error) => {
	console.log('Download canceled due to error: ', error);
});

// Pause the task
task.pause();

// Resume after pause
task.resume();

// Cancel the task
task.stop();
```

### Re-Attaching to background downloads

This is the main selling point of this library (but it's free!).

What happens to your downloads after the OS stopped your app? Well, they are still running, we just need to re-attach to them.

Add this code to app's init stage, and you'll never lose a download again!

```javascript
import RNBackgroundDownloader from 'react-native-background-downloader';

let lostTasks = await RNBackgroundDownloader.checkForExistingDownloads();
for (let task of lostTasks) {
	console.log(`Task ${task.id} was found!`);
	task.progress((percent) => {
		console.log(`Downloaded: ${percent * 100}%`);
	}).done(() => {
		console.log('Downlaod is done!');
	}).error((error) => {
		console.log('Download canceled due to error: ', error);
	});
}
```

`task.id` is very important for re-attaching the download task with any UI component representing that task, this is why you need to make sure to give sensible IDs that you know what to do with, try to avoid using random IDs.

### Using custom headers
If you need to send custom headers with your download request, you can do in it 2 ways:

1) Globally using `RNBackgroundDownloader.setHeaders()`:
```javascript
RNBackgroundDownloader.setHeaders({
    Authorization: 'Bearer 2we$@$@Ddd223'
});
```
This way, all downloads with have the given headers.

2) Per download by passing a headers object in the options of `RNBackgroundDownloader.download()`:
```javascript
let task = RNBackgroundDownloader.download({
	id: 'file123',
	url: 'https://link-to-very.large/file.zip'
	destination: `${RNBackgroundDownloader.directories.documents}/file.zip`,
	headers: {
	    Authorization: 'Bearer 2we$@$@Ddd223'
	}
}).begin((expectedBytes) => {
	console.log(`Going to download ${expectedBytes} bytes!`);
}).progress((percent) => {
	console.log(`Downloaded: ${percent * 100}%`);
}).done(() => {
	console.log('Download is done!');
}).error((error) => {
	console.log('Download canceled due to error: ', error);
});
```
Headers given in the `download` function are **merged** with the ones given in `setHeaders`.

### `checkForExistingDownloads()`

Checks for downloads that ran in background while you app was terminated. Recommended to run at the init stage of the app.

**returns**

`DownloadTask[]` - Array of tasks that were running in the background so you can re-attach callbacks to them

### `setHeaders(headers)`

Sets headers to use in all future downloads.

**headers** - Object

| Function   | Callback Arguments                | Info                                                                                                                          |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `begin`    | expectedBytes                     | Called when the first byte is received. 💡: this is good place to check if the device has enough storage space for this download |
| `progress` | percent, bytesWritten, totalBytes | Called at max every 1.5s so you can update your progress bar accordingly                                                      |
